# Lord Of The Rings, the social network.

This is a little project were I created the social network of the LOTR films from their movie scripts.       

Inside the files folder you can find the scripts, ipython notebooks with the whole process and pics of the social networks.   

There is a social network for:

* LOTR I: The Fellowship of the Ring.
* LOTR II: The Two Towers.
* LOTR III: The Return of the King.
* LOTR all: The above three merged.

I also made a Medium post showing the results:
